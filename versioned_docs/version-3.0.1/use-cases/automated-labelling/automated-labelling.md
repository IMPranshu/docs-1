Pull Requests labels are widely used by software developers to communicate certain required actions.

Out of the box, Reviewpad supports the action of [adding labels to pull requests](../docs/reviewpad-file-specification/aladino-specification/aladino-built-ins#addlabel).

Together with the other [built-in capabilities](../docs/reviewpad-file-specification/aladino-specification/aladino-built-ins), you can automate flexible PR labeling workflows.
